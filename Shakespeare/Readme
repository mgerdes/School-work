This program parses very large text files and stores each unique word. 
The program takes a text file as input, then interpretes words as a sequence of characters without anything other than
the alpha numeric characters. The program then uses a hash function to assign a word an integer, then 
this integer points to which binary tree to go look for the word in. If there is no word found then it creates
a node in that tree, if there is one found then the count for that word is increased, but no new node is made.

Without the hash function the program ran in about 1.6 - 1.7 seconds. With the has function it was about 1.3 - 1.4 seconds.

The text file I used was War and Peace by Tolstoy.

The hash function was not created by me. The hash function I created was not very good so I found one online.
